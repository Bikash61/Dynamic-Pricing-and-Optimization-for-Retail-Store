# 🧠 Dynamic Pricing and Optimization for Retail Store

This project implements a comprehensive Machine Learning pipeline for **Dynamic Pricing** and **Price Optimization** using real-world data. It aims to help retail platforms intelligently adjust product prices to maximize revenue and stay competitive in the market.

> 📘 Developed as part of the 6th semester academic project by **Bikash**, in collaboration with **Pritam Singh** and **Svati Priya**.
